# Project Euler

Project Euler solutions. Mostly written in Python 3, but probably also some other languages, too (whatever makes the most sense for the particular problem).

## Setup

I recommend using [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to set up your Python environment. Be sure to use Python 3 as the solutions won't necessarily work in Python 2.
