# Project Euler

Project Euler solutions. Mostly a testbed for trying languages I might not get to use otherwise.

## Setup

### Python

I recommend using [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to set up your Python environment. Be sure to use Python 3 as the solutions won't necessarily work in Python 2.
